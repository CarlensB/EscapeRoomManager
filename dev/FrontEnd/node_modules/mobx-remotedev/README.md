[![Mentioned in Awesome Mobx](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/mobxjs/awesome-mobx)

Remote debugging for MobX with [Redux DevTools extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) (and [remotedev](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev) coming soon)

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Installation

#### 1. Get the extension

##### 1.1 For Chrome

- from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
- or build it with `npm i & npm run build:extension` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./build/extension`
- or run it in dev mode with `npm i & npm start` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./dev`.

##### 1.2 For Firefox

- from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotedev/)
- or build it with `npm i & npm run build:firefox` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) `./build/firefox`.

##### 1.3 For Electron

- just specify `REDUX_DEVTOOLS` in [`electron-devtools-installer`](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

##### 1.4 For other browsers, for React Native, hybrid, desktop and server side apps

- Use [remotedev.io](http://remotedev.io/local/) or if you have the extension select `Remote DevTools` from the context menu. Just specify `remote` parameter, and optionally `hostname` and `port`. [See the API](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev#remotedevstore-config) for details.

#### 2. Install the library

```
npm install --save mobx-remotedev
```

## Usage

```js
import remotedev from 'mobx-remotedev';
// or import remotedev from 'mobx-remotedev/lib/dev'
// in case you want to use it in production or don't have process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'

const appStore = observable({
  // ...
});

// Or
class appStore {
  // ...
}

export default remotedev(appStore);
```

Or as ES decorator:

```js
import remotedev from 'mobx-remotedev';

@remotedev(/*{ config }*/)
export default class appStore {
  // ...
}
```

See [counter](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/counter/stores/appState.js), [simple-todo](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/simple-todo/index.js) and [todomvc](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/tree/master/examples/todomvc/src/stores) examples.

## API

#### `remotedev(store, [config])`

- arguments
  - **store** _observable or class_ to be monitored. In case you want to change its values (to time travel or cancel actions), you should export its result as in the example above (so we can extend the class).
  - **config** _object_ (optional as the parameters bellow)
    - **name** _string_ - the instance name to be showed on the monitor page. Default value is document.title.
    - **onlyActions** _boolean_ - set it to `true` to have a clear log only with actions. If MobX is in strict mode, it is `true` by default. Don't forget about [async actions](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev#how-to-handle-async-actions).
    - **global** _boolean_ - set it to `true` in order to assign dispatching of all unhandled actions to this store. Useful for nested classes / observables or when having async actions without specifying the `scope` explicitly.
    - **filters** _object_ - map of arrays named `whitelist` or `blacklist` to filter action types. You can also set it globally in the extension settings.
      - **blacklist** _array of (regex as string)_ - actions to be hidden in DevTools.
      - **whitelist** _array of (regex as string)_ - all other actions will be hidden in DevTools (the `blacklist` parameter will be ignored).
    - **remote** _boolean_ - set it to `true` to have remote monitoring via the local or `remotedev.io` server. `remote: false` is used for [the extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) or [react-native-debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)
    - **hostname** _string_ - use to specify host for [`remotedev-server`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev-server). If `port` is specified, default value is `localhost`.
    - **port** _number_ - use to specify host's port for [`remotedev-server`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev-server).

## Exclude / include DevTools in production builds

By default use

```js
import remotedev from 'mobx-remotedev';
```

It will work only when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`, otherwise the code will be stripped.

In case you want to use it in production or cannot set `process.env.NODE_ENV`, use

```js
import remotedev from 'mobx-remotedev/lib/dev';
```

So, the code will not be stripped from production bundle and you can use the extension even in production. It wouldn't affect the performance for end-users who don't have the extension installed.

## FAQ

### How to monitor (show changes) for inner items

Use `remotedev` function for them as well. [Example](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/simple-todo/index.js#L22)

### How to set data correctly when time traveling

By default it will try to set the properties of the class or observable object, but, if you have an `importState` method, it will be used. [Example](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/todomvc/src/stores/TodoStore.js#L56)

### How to disable computations when time traveling

Check `__isRemotedevAction` of your class or observable object, which will be set to true when it's a monitor action. [Example](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/todomvc/src/stores/TodoStore.js#L22)

### How to handle async actions

Use `runInAction` and don't forget about the second / third parameter which will be `this` if you're using arrow functions. If you don't want to specify it, set the `global` parameter to `true`. [Example](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/blob/master/examples/counter/stores/appState.js#L14)

### How to show actions for nested classes / observables

Just set the `global` parameter to `true` like `remotedev(store, { global: true })`. If you want more details about the nested tree, see [#5](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/mobx-remotedev/pull/5).
